<p>“I have often thought that it is easier to make nice people smart than it is to make smart people nice.  However, with this book Elia may have proven me wrong.  During my career I have learned that a truly engaged and happy workforce will increase productivity more quickly than anything else. Dr. Gourgouris’ principles can help everyone understand the key to their own happiness, and as an employer, the key to employee engagement.  These 7 paths are easily followed and available to anyone - the result could very well be the personal success and happiness you have been seeking!”</p>

<p> “This very informative and entertaining book exceeded my expectations. Dr. Elia Gourgouris illustrates through simple concepts, relatable stories and worksheets how one can walk through the 7 Paths to Lasting Happiness within their life. While many seem to be all too willing to point fingers at others for holding them back from being happy, Dr. Gourgouris provides a roadmap with which one can shift their mindset, become happy and, in the process, lead a more fulfilling life. I personally love “the NIMBI Principle.”</p>
