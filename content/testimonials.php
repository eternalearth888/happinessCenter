"I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Elia Gourgouris a couple of weeks ago. He was nice enough to lend me a copy of his book. It is a great read and the activity pages are very helpful. Some of the principals were ones that I knew but needed to be reminded of. Many of the principals however gave me a different perspective on topics of being happy and healthy! I think it is a great read for families as well as individuals"

"Dr Elia's book has become a tool that I keep in my office and ask my clients to read! I love the concept of turning our minds in to a "peaceful harbor." It is obvious that Dr Elia has several years of wisdom and insight all cleanly portrayed in his book. As a psychotherapist myself I am always looking for the best book to recommend to my clients and I found it! This is truly a special gift."

"As the father of a young family it is hard sometimes to find lasting happiness in a world where they are selling the exact opposite. I can truly say that as I read this book my perspective started to change and I started to see the joys and simple blessings that are very abundant in my own life. It was great to start to have a change of perspective especially when I am so naturally a pessimist. This book is a great way to start changing and start finding meaningful paths to lasting happiness."

"I had a wonderful time reading this book. I usually consider myself very happy and it validated most of my feelings. Even so, there was much to learn and apply in my own life. I especially loved the chapter on forgiveness! This book is great whether you are exultant or morose!"

"This book makes the steps to finding lasting happiness simple and achievable. Every time I picked the book up I was excited because I felt like I really could increase my level of happiness. It is written in a way that is easy to understand and personalize to your own need. I particularly like how the "points to ponder" and "questions to consider" section at the end of each chapter helps with personalizing the content read in the chapter. It is a book you can read over and over and improve each time. Well worth taking the time to read and to take the actions outlined in the book."

"I just finished "7 Paths" and I want you to know that I thoroughly enjoyed it, that it was a most pleasurable read. I think it is a truly
beautiful and inspiring book: so personal, yet universal, so positive without being inappropriately didactical, filled with simple, but
eloquent advice and recommendations. In reading it, over and over I could feel your kindness showing through. I learned a lot from it, about
many things that I want to do, or do better. I can't thank you enough for your efforts. I would recommend this book to anyone seeking happiness and joy!"

"I wrapped up chapter 2 last night and have the 2x4 between the eyes feeling of an awakening of self that I have always wanted to experience. These are things I can do, not just sayings and feel good platitudes. The worksheets help me put words to my feelings and are the beginning of a plan that is going to change my life!"

"Rare to find such wise and profound truths interwoven with the humor and down to earth ways every reader can use to better their lives and be a happier person. Dr Gourgouris has perhaps discovered one of the 'Holy Grails' of our humanity. Our gift to ourselves and everyone in our lives stems from our willingness and capacity to embrace love, to be open to this happiness and to give aid to others along the path. In his book, Dr Gourgouris not only helps his readers see their own and others' happiness and potential, but also inspires us to change, to improve. Throughout his book there are hundreds of quotes.. I love them! They give the sense that many of our world's greatest thinkers throughout time had similar hopes for our happiness and were waiting for someone like Dr Gourgouris to put their voices together to be heard. This book definitely earns it's place on our shelf and in our hearts!"

<p>"This is a really wonderful book.It contains important insights and great stories to illustrate the principles being taught. It does an especially good job in helping to close the gap between what we know and what we do. We all "know" more than what we "do." I found the book very helpful in motivating me to try to close that gap." </p>

<p>“I have often thought that it is easier to make nice people smart than it is to make smart people nice.  However, with this book Elia may have proven me wrong.  During my career I have learned that a truly engaged and happy workforce will increase productivity more quickly than anything else. Dr. Gourgouris’ principles can help everyone understand the key to their own happiness, and as an employer, the key to employee engagement.  These 7 paths are easily followed and available to anyone - the result could very well be the personal success and happiness you have been seeking!”</p>

<p> “This very informative and entertaining book exceeded my expectations. Dr. Elia Gourgouris illustrates through simple concepts, relatable stories and worksheets how one can walk through the 7 Paths to Lasting Happiness within their life. While many seem to be all too willing to point fingers at others for holding them back from being happy, Dr. Gourgouris provides a roadmap with which one can shift their mindset, become happy and, in the process, lead a more fulfilling life. I personally love “the NIMBI Principle.”</p>

<p>"I have known Dr. Gourgouris for over 15 years, during which I have both met with him personally and have attended many of his lectures. He is extremely knowledgeable, intuitive, and experienced - with over 25,000 hours of counseling and coaching clients which have come mostly through personal referrals. There is no greater proof of customer satisfaction than that! He is also one of the most engaging speakers I have ever heard; each workshop I have attended has been informative, entertaining, and presented in a thoughtful and interesting manner. As you can tell, I am an avid fan and admirer of Dr. Gourgouris and his work - he is one of the most gifted and talented people I have ever met"

The tools he gave me are priceless - they will help me throughout the rest of my life."
