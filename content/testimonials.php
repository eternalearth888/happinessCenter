<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<p>&#8220;I have known Dr. Gourgouris for over 15 years, during which I have both met with him personally and have attended many of his lectures. He is extremely knowledgeable, intuitive, and experienced - with over 25,000 hours of counseling and coaching clients which have come mostly through personal referrals. There is no greater proof of customer satisfaction than that! He is also one of the most engaging speakers I have ever heard; each workshop I have attended has been informative, entertaining, and presented in a thoughtful and interesting manner. As you can tell, I am an avid fan and admirer of Dr. Gourgouris and his work - he is one of the most gifted and talented people I have ever met.&#8221;<br>~ <span class="author">Susanne P.
