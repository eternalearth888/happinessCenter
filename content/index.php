<p>Our primary goal at The Happiness Center is to help as many individuals as possible to create long-lasting happiness.&nbsp; We believe that in a world which is often stressful, challenging, and demanding, happiness seems to have become more and more elusive.&nbsp; Living life in just a survival mode has become, unfortunately, the norm for many people.&nbsp; The Happiness Center believes that every individual is entitled to true happiness and all that it entails.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that happiness can usually be traced back to several components:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Life balance</b>, which includes the physical, emotional and spiritual parts of our lives.  It also includes finding balance between family, relationships, and career.</li>
<li><b>Discovering passion in all areas of your life</b></li>
<li><b>Developing a positive outlook and becoming a life-long optimist</b></li>
<li><b>Finding your authentic, higher self</b></li>
<li><b>Living life with an attitude of gratitude</b></li>
<li><b>Achieving higher levels of personal enlightenment</b></li>
</ul>
