<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Aristotle had it right when he said:
“Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.”

Being happy every day is achievable!  Not the superficial happiness that many seem to seek, but deep-down, lasting happiness. 
Our primary goal at The Happiness Center is to help as many individuals as possible create long-lasting happiness. We believe that in a world that is often stressful, challenging and demanding, happiness seems to have become more and more elusive. Living life in just a survival mode has become, unfortunately, the norm for many people.  
The Happiness Center believes that every individual is entitled to true happiness and all that it entails. 
At The Happiness Center, we offer coaching services to individuals, couples and their families.  It is our mission to help people acquire the tools necessary to achieve the happiness they deserve. 
To find out how we can assist you and those you love to gain lasting happiness, we invite you to take a look at the services we provide and then contact us.
