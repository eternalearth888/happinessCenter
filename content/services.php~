 <p>
Studies have shown that happiness can usually be traced back to seven principles:
<ul>
<li>Loving yourself by finding life balance, in all aspects of your life</li>
<li>Being grateful and optimistic</li>
<li>Being forgiving</li>
<li>Discovering and following your passion</li>
<li>Nourishing your spirit</li>
<li>Connecting with others</li>
<li>Serving others</li>
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, one circular aspect of happiness that some people miss is the simple fact that the happier you are, the more you will bless the lives of those around you.  And, the more you reach out to bless the lives of those around you, the happier you become.  Spreading happiness to others is what gives our lives meaning and makes us truly happy.
